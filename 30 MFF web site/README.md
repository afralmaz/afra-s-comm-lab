*What's it like to multi-task in a zoom class?


Project description:

The video my classmates and I worked on revolves around how students try to focus on an online class but start to get distracted with doing random tasks during class that helps them focus more! 
Things you can only do when its an online class, like making breakfast while listening to your professor talk, or crotetching a blanket (guilty pleasure), or even just doodling.
The overall concept and theme of the project is creating relatable content that students understand, that can be a guide for students who enjoy multi-tasking in nondistracting ways while still being a part of the class.

Process:

When I first started working on the wireframe, I felt a little lost on where to begin or how to organize my website panels. I started with a sketch on my notebook, then used
canva.com to create my wireframe because it was the most accessible application I had at hand. After writing down my ideas for the home and 'about' page, I also made a panel that
could be a rule handbook for 'having fun & focusing in class'. As someone who struggles with concentrating on one thing for too long, being busy in non-distracting ways always helps me focus in class.

Reflection:

When I first started working on the webframe, I did not have many eexpectations for myself because it was my first time working on one. I went with the flow, researched different wire-frames and looked at other work
which helped me a lot. I am happy with my final product because it is simple and organized. All the information about our project could be layed out in an interactive way that allows other students with weak concentration skills (oh no) to relate to.
My goals were met in the end because I conquered my fear of webframes!

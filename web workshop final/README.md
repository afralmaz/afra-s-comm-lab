Project Name: There's a zoom meeting, then there's me!

Project description: 

About the 30mff movie: Our 30MFF short film is a story about not being able to stay still in a zoom class! Our minds are always wandering around, so what do we do when we try to focus? Doodle, crochet a scarf, reogranize our desks, light a candle. Most importantly, try not to open another tab!

The conecept and theme: The concept of my website is colorful, I would compare it to a journal from the drawings I placed in each website. I tried to make it attention-grabbing with the orange and blue, and the added drawings. 

The experience I wanted to create was a simple yet immersing exploration of our film. 

Process and reflection:

I started off by creating a wireframe, but the end result was much different than the draft. It's my first time coding a website, and that was scary. The thing I struggled with the most is javascript because of the complicated way of writing down commands. 
Watching youtube videos and looking at W3Schools.com helped a lot but seperating the html, css and javascript was very confusing. I enjoyed css the most because I enjoyed decorating the website, and was proud of myself every time I placed an image or text the place I wanted to put it in.

Project Name: There's a zoom meeting, then there's me!

Project description: 

About the 30mff movie: Our 30MFF short film is a story about not being able to stay still in a zoom class! Our minds are always wandering around, so what do we do when we try to focus? Doodle, crochet a scarf, reogranize our desks, light a candle. Most importantly, try not to open another tab!

The conecept and theme: The concept of my website is colorful, I would compare it to a journal from the drawings I placed in each website. I tried to make it attention-grabbing with the orange and added drawings.
